                Messi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the
                world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the
                world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in
                the world in 2011 and 2012.

                    In the great 'Lionel Messi versus Cristiano Ronaldo' debate, one of the major marks against the
                    No.10 is his lack of success on the international stage with Argentina.

                    Messi and Ronaldo have dominated the landscape at club level for over a decade, collecting 11
                    Ballons d'Or between them for their exploits, but each has struggled to replicate that success with
                    their national teams.

                    The year 2016 saw Ronaldo clinch his first major international honour with Portugal as they won the
                    European Championship and the Juventus talisman added the UEFA Nations League to his haul in 2019.
